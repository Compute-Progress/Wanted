Algorithm to randomize start position :
    - Wanted position : 
        - Pick a random crowd face
        - Attenpt to hid behind it (offset the position in x and y)
    - All random or clusters
        - Cluster :
            - Random width and hieght (within a certain range)
            - Moving or non moving
                -Moving : 
                    - Pick movement functions:
                        - 8 caridnal directions
                        - Sin
                        - Circle
    - Difficulty goes up :
        - More faces (up to acertain cap)
        - Position offset decreases (but never completely matches)
    
Timer goes up by 15 sec for every correct and down by 5 for every wrong
