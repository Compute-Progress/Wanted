Algorithm to randomize start position :
    - Wanted position : 
        - Pick a random crowd face DONE
        - Attenpt to hid behind it (offset the position in x and y)DONE
    - All random or clusters
        - Cluster :
            - Random width and hieght (within a certain range)
            - Moving or non moving
                -Moving : 
                    - Pick movement functions:
                        - 8 caridnal directions
                        - Sin
                        - Circle
    - Difficulty goes up :
        - More faces (up to acertain cap)
        - Position offset decreases (but never completely matches)
    
Timer goes up by 15 sec for every correct and down by 5 for every wrong
Start with 15 secss
Resizeable window                    


Check positions :
    X Circle
    X Random
    X LINE

Check movement:
    X Circle
    X LINE
    X Sine
    X Random

X Next level when found
X Level difficulty (add more sprites)

X Correct pffset for wanted sprite
X Refactor
