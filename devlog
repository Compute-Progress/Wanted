    Cloned repo. Quantum vault still proves to be really useful when starting projects. Granted, this is very simple and doesn't require many dependicies.
    Something cool to build would be an auto update makefile.

    Thinking about the init and game loop process, I quite liked the one I had previously. I'm also thinking about conventions to use , there too I quite like what I had before
    but I think it could be improved in some ways : 
        ------ Naming and vars -------
        - Functions, files, struct names to be prefixed with SDLX_, unless internal in which case to be prefixed with _SDLX_internal
        - Functions must follow the following scheme : SDLX_TargetObject_FunctionPurpose (to follow SDL's convention)
        - Variables must follow the following scheme : snake_case 
            -prefixed : 
                internal:   _intern_, 
                safe/sanitized: s_ 
                user input: usr_
                relevant to rendering system : rdr_

        - Use uint types or SDL_int if there is sucha  thing (very minor, but as in length is implementation defined, still useful)
        - Functions shall return a proper error code, and it shall be linked to an enum contianing all error codes
        - SDLX shall NOT allocate any data (or allocate as little as it possibly can)
        - SDLX shall not hide any varibales or structs or do so as little as it possibly can

    After a lot of thinking and wrting up the above, it is time to start coding;
